In this project, we are presented with an exciting challenge: performing sentiment analysis on a vast dataset of Amazon reviews focusing on cell phones and accessories.
Our primary goal is to explore a variety of deep learning models and traditional machine learning methods to predict sentiment, treating the task as a multi-class classification problem.
Logistic Regression Triumph: Achieved the highest accuracy of 62% among traditional machine learning methods.
LSTM Excellence: Best LSTM model with 3 layers and 20 units delivered an impressive 60.31% accuracy.

Word embeddings, like word2vec, Google word2vec, and GloVe, showcased same accuracy.
Bert: Seeing the training loss decrease indicates my model fitting training data better. Decreasing validation loss suggests my model generalizing well to new data.
